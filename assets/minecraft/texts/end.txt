§2Enmity, made by Veird.

§2Thanks for being here,§3 PLAYERNAME§2.

§2This is the part where I make a wall of text about how great my creation is and you sit and read it patiently.

§2Actually, good job on getting through all of this... unless you played on normal mode, if so then go away.

§2Before we get on and you do something more interesting than reading the credits, let's a have a quick chat.

§2This is all being written at the time when Enmity isn't released to public yet. 

§2I'm also not going to change these credits in the future, just as a memorial.

§2I've already spent lots of time making this thing, I should probably go touch some grass.

§2If you're reading this, then I'm probably going to spend even more.

§2I'm really glad that Enmity became a thing, I had never expected it to get this far.

§2Unlike the countless projects that I've abandoned.

§2I don't care if what some will remember me for is a Minecraft datapack.

§3What I care about is that you suffered going through it.


§2Now, go take the Dragon's egg and make the Delirium.
